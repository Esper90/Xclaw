# Xclaw Privacy & Terms of Service

## 1. Data Collection & Usage
Xclaw is a private AI agent. To function, we securely store:
*   **X (Twitter) Credentials**: Used solely to perform actions you request (posting, reading DMs, etc.). These are stored in an encrypted database.
*   **Memories**: Your conversations and uploaded files are converted into "semantic embeddings" and stored in a private database (Pinecone) to provide your agent with long-term context.
*   **Session Data**: Temporary chat history is kept to maintain flow during a conversation.

## 2. Your Control & Privacy
You have absolute control over your data. Your data is never sold, shared, or used for advertising.
*   Use **/deletekeys** at any time to instantly wipe your X credentials, API keys, and account settings from our database.
*   Use **/forget [topic]** to delete specific memories.
*   Use **/forgetall** at any time to permanently wipe your entire long-term memory bank.

## 3. Assumption of Risk (AI & API)
By using Xclaw, you acknowledge that:
*   **AI Actions:** Xclaw uses AI to generate content. You are solely responsible for any tweets, replies, or direct messages sent by Xclaw on your behalf.
*   **API Costs & Limits:** Xclaw interacts with your personal X Developer App. You are solely responsible for any costs, rate limits, or account suspensions incurred on your X Developer account or main X account.
*   **No Guarantees:** We provide Xclaw "as is" without warranties. We are not liable for any lost data, missed messages, or unintended public posts.

## 4. Acceptable Use & Banning
Xclaw is designed as a personal assistant, not a spam bot. We reserve the right to ban users, revoke access, and delete data without notice if Xclaw is used to generate abusive content, spam, or violate the terms of service of X (Twitter), Telegram, or Google Gemini.

## 5. Third-Party Services
Xclaw utilizes Google Gemini AI (no user data is used for global model training), the X API, and Supabase & Pinecone for secure, private data storage.
